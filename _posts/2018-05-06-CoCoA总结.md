#### Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;New computing systems have emerged in response to the increasing size and complexity
of modern datasets. For best performance, machine learning methods must be designed to
closely align with the underlying properties of these systems.
In this thesis, we illustrate the impact of system-aware machine learning through the
lens of optimization, a crucial component in formulating and solving most machine learning
problems. Classically, the performance of an optimization method is measured in terms of
accuracy (i.e., does it realize the correct machine learning model? ) and convergence rate
(after how many iterations? ). In modern computing regimes, however, it becomes critical to
additionally consider a number of systems-related aspects for best overall performance. These
aspects can range from low-level details, such as data structures or machine specifications,
to higher-level concepts, such as the tradeoff between communication and computation.
We propose a general optimization framework for machine learning, CoCoA, that gives
careful consideration to systems parameters, often incorporating them directly into the
method and theory. We illustrate the impact of CoCoA in two popular distributed regimes:
the traditional cluster-computing environment, and the increasingly common setting of ondevice
(federated) learning. Our results indicate that by marrying systems-level parameters
and optimization techniques, we can achieve orders-of-magnitude speedups for solving modern
machine learning problems at scale. We corroborate these empirical results by providing
theoretical guarantees that expose systems parameters to give further insight into empirical
performance.
